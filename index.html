    <h1>Welcome to FC's Personal Site</h1>
    <p> My Background: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francois-chaubard-0a169448/">Linked In</a></p>
    <p>I believe strongly in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06413">"Science in the Open" </a> ethos and as part of that, 
        I want to open a window into the research I am doing even in the "nascent" stages of such research, even if that means it may get poached,
        thats ok, if it will accelerate the attainment of man-kind's research goals. So I will try to dedicate a few hours a week to 
        documenting what I am doing / thinking about here in a raw / open format. </p>
