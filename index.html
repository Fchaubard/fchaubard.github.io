    <h1>Welcome to FC's Personal Site</h1>
    <h2>I believe strongly in the "Science in the Open" ethos and as part of that, I want to open a window into the research I am doing even in the "nascent" stages of such research, even if that means it may get poached, thats ok, if it will accelerate the attainment of man-kind's research goals. So I will try to dedicate a few hours a week to documenting what I am doing / thinking about here in a raw / open format. </h2>
