    <title>Living in the Future: Information Flow, Temporal Lag, and the Geography of Innovation</title>

    <h1>Novel Token Spickets: Put yourself right next to the source of novel tokens, not second-hand smoke, but first-hand</h1>

    <p>When you look at the night sky, you are looking into the past. The Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away, meaning its photons striking your retina tonight left when early hominins were still figuring out how to bang rocks together. This is a hard constraint of physics: <strong>information takes time to travel</strong>. </p>

    <p>The same principle applies to ideas, perspectives, and intellectual progress. Just as astronomical distance creates temporal lag, <strong>geographical and institutional distance creates "epistemic lag"</strong>. Why does the US not get the middle east and visa versa? Why does DC and Silicon Valley differ so much in perspective? Why does a NYC quant interview and a SV DL interview literally have no jaccard similarity yet are hitting on many of the same topics. Information/Perspective is not evenly distributed; it has points of origin, diffusion pathways, and varying rates of transmission. If you want to be on the cutting edge, if you want to live in "the future" how? where do you live? what do you do all day? The question is actually: <strong>where do the novel tokens originate, and then how to minimize the time for them to reach you?</strong></p>

    <p>Just like photons from andromeda, watching the news is watching the past. Not just in the trivial sense that it happened hours ago, but in the deeper sense that the underlying research, business decisions, and technical implementations were conceived long before the press release. The rest of us are merely observing the afterglow.</p>

    <p>Raw information originates in primary sources: closed-door meetings at OpenAI/Anthropic, experimental labs at DeepMind, informal conversations in Menlo Park cafes, or pitch meetings in A16Z. And even before that, there is a laptop and a person that an "ah ha" moment occurs.. that is the origination point. That is the first hand smoke. Everything else is second hand or worse. </p>
    
    <h2>The “Filter Lag” Problem in Information Systems</h2>

    <p>Even worse is how we update our priors after receiving that information. In signal processing, there’s a well-known phenomenon called <strong>filter lag</strong>. Any system that processes information—whether a Kalman filter tracking an object, or a financial analyst digesting market signals—will always be slightly behind reality. Filtering requires aggregation, smoothing, and verification, which introduce delay.</p>

    <p>Consider the media ecosystem as a filtering mechanism. This filtering process introduces an inevitable lag between <em>when something is known</em> and <em>when it is known widely</em>.</p>

    <p>For those consuming information solely through news outlets, academic journals, or industry reports, the result is clear: you are experiencing a delayed snapshot of a past reality. If you want to operate on <em>real-time</em> information, you need to be closer—physically, socially, or professionally—to the source.</p>

    <h2>The Geography of Novel Token Generation</h2>

    <p>Consider how large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge. They predict the next token based on statistical correlations in past data. Their epistemology is retrospective; they do not <em>generate</em> fundamentally new information but remix existing tokens in ways that approximate novelty.</p>

    <p>The same is true for human knowledge consumption. If your intellectual diet consists primarily of secondhand sources—news articles, research papers, analyst reports—you are engaging in a form of autoregressive token prediction. You are not in the domain where <strong>novel tokens</strong> are generated; you are in the domain where existing tokens are recombined.</p>

    <p>So where do <em>new</em> tokens originate? In environments of <strong>high-entropy innovation</strong>—places where new concepts, frameworks, and heuristics are actively being developed rather than merely disseminated. Historically, these environments have been geographically concentrated:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rome (c. 100 AD)</strong>: The administrative and intellectual hub of an empire, where legal and infrastructural innovations originated.</li>
        <li><strong>New York City (c. 1920-2000)</strong>: The financial and media capital of the modern world, where economic and cultural information was first synthesized.</li>
        <li><strong>Silicon Valley (c. 1990-present)</strong>: The epicenter of computational, AI, and hardware innovation, where the future of technology is actively being shaped.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To return to the LLM analogy: if you are far from these generative environments, your information diet consists of <strong>tokens from the past</strong>, not real-time novel tokens. Being physically or socially close to these environments increases the probability that your cognitive model is trained on cutting-edge data rather than lagging distributions.</p>

    <h2>How to Reduce the Lag Without Moving to Silicon Valley</h2>

    <p>Not everyone can—or wants to—move to the Bay Area. But the core problem remains: how do you minimize epistemic lag without geographical proximity? Here are some heuristics:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Follow Primary Sources:</strong> Instead of reading mass media reports on AI, follow AI researchers directly. Many publish preprints on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> or share insights on Twitter/X long before their work is covered in mainstream outlets.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage in High-Entropy Networks:</strong> The more homogenous your intellectual environment, the more likely you are to be downstream of already-processed information. Seek out networks where new ideas are actively generated.</li>
        <li><strong>Participate in Open Research & Development:</strong> Many cutting-edge projects in AI, cryptography, and biotech happen in open-source communities. Contributing to these projects brings you closer to the information frontier.</li>
        <li><strong>Build Social Proximity to Novelty:</strong> Information is often transmitted through informal networks. If you cannot physically relocate to an innovation hub, cultivate relationships with those embedded in such environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize When You Are Consuming Stale Tokens:</strong> The simplest but most powerful heuristic: when you hear about something, ask yourself, <em>How long has this information been known in the primary source community?</em> If the answer is months or years, you are operating on lagging indicators.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion: Living in the Future is an Information Optimization Problem</h2>

    <p>The experience of “living in the future” is ultimately an artifact of <strong>information flow dynamics</strong>. If you are geographically, socially, or intellectually distant from information-generating hubs, you are necessarily consuming filtered, lagging data. The greater this lag, the more outdated your model of reality becomes.</p>

    <p>Silicon Valley is not special because of some intrinsic property of its geography, but because it has become the central node in the global information network for technological innovation. If you want to live in the future, you need to optimize for <strong>proximity to novel tokens</strong>. This is not a metaphor; it is a fundamental principle of information theory, epistemic economics, and network science.</p>

    <p>The future is an unevenly distributed function of information flow. Your position in that function determines whether you are predicting the next token—or generating it.</p>
