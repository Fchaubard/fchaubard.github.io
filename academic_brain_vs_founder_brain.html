  <h1>Academic Brain vs. Founder Brain</h1>
  <p>I see many academics try to start companies. While there are some example of this working out: Coursera, Tableau, Google (though Larry/Sergey were still early in the PhD when they left), all of Chris Re's companies, etc. There are <b>many</b> example of this not working out. The habits, skills, and instincts that make a great academic are almost antithetical to what would make you a great founder. Academics need to <i>unlearn</i> the instincts beat into them by their PIs to make it as founders. They have the intelligence to pull it off, but most dont have the will. I break it down to a few key issues below.</p>

  <h2>Most of what Academics care about would be deemed "Vanity Metrics" to a common startup CEO</h2>
<p>Academic Brain is focused on # of citations and # of papers published (literally the only 2 measures in H-Index calculation); Founder Brain is focused on the customer's problems and walking backwards. In a lab, a 1% lift on a benchmark is exciting; in startups, who the hell cares? In school you optimized for Reviewer #2; in startups you optimize for your customer. The academic asks, “Is this novel?” The founder asks, “Novel? Who cares.. Will anyone pay for this by Friday if we build it?”. The researcher loves a new loss function; the founder loves watching a user share their screen and say, “oh wow, that button finally works!” Its a completely different sport.</p>

<h2>Focused on the Unimportant but Interesting vs. Important</h2>
<p>In startups, you dont have time. You are dying. You are falling out of the sky while you are trying to assemble the plane. You dont have time to worry about why this tweak to the tokenizer results in an improvement, it just does, and thats good enough. Empericism is fine. The scent for what is important and what is not is completely different. Important = anything that moves the needle for the business: sign-ups, activation, retention, revenue, or referrals. Unimport = anything that is extremely interesting but doesnt move the needle, may make your brain tingle though! Proving a new lemma that your algorithm is globally optimal? Unimportant. Visiting 10 users to get feedback on a new launch? Important. Publishing. Unimportant. Pushing product. Important. Many academic startups die because they are run out of money focusing on the interesting but unimportant before they get to PMF and default alive.</p>

<h2>Novelty</h2>
<p>The next one is a big one. Academia LOVES novelty. You dont get published with a me-too paper.. BUT in startups not true! You can become a billionaire with me-too'ing. e.g. Building Uber 2.0 (lyft) or OpenAI 2.0 (Anthropic) or Instacart for Latam (Rappi). In fact, that is derisking! Novelty is a liability in startups. </p>

<h2>Rigor in Assertions</h2>
<p>Academic rigor = hedging: “We cautiously hypothesize (p &lt; 0.05) that…” Founder rigor = falsifiable claims you can test next week: “We cut your invoice processing time by 30%—try it on three vendors, no credit card.” Replace footnotes with quick and dirty A/B tests at best, otherwise go on gut a 3-4 in person customer interviews. You dont have time to get to stat-sig most the time. You need to move. Sometimes you will have time for 'some' rigor. But that is usually way post PMF. </p>

<h2>Im sooo smart</h2>
<p>You need confidence to run anything, but humility is really important. No one wants to work for a brilliant a-hole. No one cares about how much you know about finite automata and prototype trees. Just stop. Academics can come off like complete jerks because they are so smart and so right it actually just is not effective. Yes you may be smarter than your customers and investors. So what? Why shove it in their face? A more intelligent person would drop the ego, and be so curious about how other people's brains work and why they do what they do that it wouldnt be about letting the world know how smart I am.. but how cool THEY are and how much I can learn from THEM. Academics are awful at this. But you can choose otherwise!</p>
  
<h2>Curious about People</h2>
<p>The last and most important issue, academics are not curious about people which makes them poor leaders and low empathy for their users; This gives them a rough API and turn off many people. Founders must be able to close deals, attract/retain great talent, raise millions. That takes an interest in people. Even more so, you need to really empathize with your customer. Who buys (procurement), who uses it (the intern), who signs (the VP), who blocks (IT), and who suffers currently (?) are all the real variables and those a people problems. Sitting in on support calls, ask “what did you try before us?” and “what breaks right after you click ‘export’?” You’re building for real people. Dana who has 14 tabs open and a deadline in 12 minutes and just wants it to work. Be scholar-level curious about their pain, not beautiful ideas in your head. This is a major shift that needs to be practiced. 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and SPIN selling are my go to resources. If you are very poor on EQ, perhaps Dale C' How to win friends and influence people.</p>
