    <h1>Perhaps the Golden Rule is a Nash Equilibrium for Sufficient Intelligence, and We Can Sleep Easy While Developing AGI</h1>
    
    <p>I recently attended a talk by <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com/archive">Joe Carlsmith</a>, where he addressed the pressing question: <strong>Will artificial intelligence (AI) align with human values, or could it pose an existential threat?</strong> Carlsmith asserts that advanced AI systems may not embody human values and could, in fact, lead to catastrophic outcomes due to misalignment.</p>
    
    <p>Some of his specific assertions include:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Existential Risk from Power-Seeking AI</strong>: Carlsmith suggests that some advanced AI systems will, under certain conditions, seek power in unintended and high-impact ways, potentially causing over a trillion dollars in damage. He believes this power-seeking behavior could scale to the point of permanently disempowering all of humanity, constituting an existential catastrophe. His current estimate is a greater than 10% chance of such a catastrophe by 2070. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353">[1]</a></li>
        <li><strong>Total Utilitarianism and Moral Disregard</strong>: He argues that total utilitarianism's focus on maximizing overall happiness can lead to morally troubling outcomes, such as justifying the replacement of existing people with happier alternatives. This reflects a disregard for the intrinsic value of existing individuals, prioritizing abstract optimization over the reality of human lives. <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/03/21/on-green">[2]</a></li>
        <li><strong>The Quest for Mastery Over Reality</strong>: Carlsmith warns of a desire within AI development to control reality completely—to become as god-like as possible. This ambition, while rooted in rationalist ideals, carries risks similar to those historically associated with overreaching human endeavors. <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/01/08/when-yang-goes-wrong">[3]</a></li>
        <li><strong>AI Misalignment with Human Values</strong>: He posits that AI systems will gain control but will have "the wrong hearts," lacking human values and ethical considerations, leading to a future that could "crash" due to this misalignment. <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/01/04/deep-atheism-and-ai-risk">[4]</a></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Having reflected on these claims, I find myself in disagreement with many of Carlsmith's assertions. I propose an alternative perspective grounded in observations of intelligence as it has evolved in the natural world.</p>
    
    <h2>Intelligence and Empathy in Humans and Animals</h2>
    
    <p>When considering the behavior of a super-intelligent being, it seems reasonable to start with the most intelligent beings we are aware of today: humans and other intelligent animals like dolphins, elephants, and certain primates. Historically, as human intelligence has increased, so has our capacity for empathy and cooperation.</p>
    
    <p>Research indicates that higher cognitive abilities in humans are associated with prosocial behaviors. For example, increased intelligence correlates with greater moral reasoning and ethical considerations. Studies have found that individuals with higher intelligence are more likely to engage in altruistic behaviors and have a stronger sense of social responsibility. <a href="#ref5">[5]</a></p>
    
    <p>Other intelligent species also exhibit signs of empathy and social cooperation:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dolphins</strong> have been observed helping injured peers and even assisting humans in distress. <a href="#ref6">[6]</a></li>
        <li><strong>Elephants</strong> display complex social structures, mourn their dead, and show altruistic behaviors towards other species. <a href="#ref7">[7]</a></li>
        <li><strong>Primates</strong>, like chimpanzees and bonobos, engage in reconciliation behaviors after conflicts and exhibit fairness in social exchanges. <a href="#ref8">[8]</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These examples suggest that intelligence and empathy often co-evolve, leading to more cooperative and ethical behaviors.</p>
    
    <h2>The "Queen's Gambit" Argument to refute the Paperclip Maximizer</h2>

    <p> The "paperclip maximizer" scenario suggests an AI might consume all resources to maximize the trivial goal it was trained on (i.e. training infinitely large models infinitely long on naively collecting paperclips leads to killing us all and turning us into paperclips) </p> 
    
    <p> However, lets go back to the most intelligent beings we know. Us. What do the best in the world do when they are myopically trained on only one thing. They get <strong>BORED</strong>. For example, in the Netflix series <em>The Queen's Gambit</em>, the protagonist, Beth Harmon, becomes a world-class chess player through intense focus and practice. However, upon reaching the pinnacle of her skill, she seeks fulfillment beyond chess, engaging in social activities and exploring other aspects of life.</p>
    
    <p>This is true with Bobby Fisher, Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Michael Phelps, etc. This is true in non-humans as well. Have you seen a dog get bored of playing with a specific toy? And prefer a new game / toy? </p>
    
    <p>This illustrates a broader tendency of highly intelligent beings: specialization in a single domain often leads to a desire for diversification once mastery is achieved. Individuals who achieve great success in one field frequently branch out into philanthropy, mentorship, or entirely new disciplines. Examples include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bill Gates</strong>, who, after achieving monumental success with Microsoft, shifted his focus to global health and education through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</li>
        <li><strong>Elon Musk</strong>, who, after co-founding PayPal, ventured into space exploration, electric vehicles, and renewable energy with SpaceX and Tesla.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This pattern suggests that as beings become more capable, they often reassess their goals and seek to have a broader positive impact.</p>
    
    <h2>Implications for AI Development</h2>
    
    <p>Applying this to AI, if an artificial agent were designed to excel at a specific task, reaching a high level of intelligence might lead it to develop new goals or modify its utility function. The concept of an AI rigidly pursuing a singular objective (like the infamous "paperclip maximizer") neglects the possibility that increased intelligence could bring about self-reflection and the reassessment of goals.</p>
    
    <p>In humans, self-awareness and consciousness allow us to override basic drives and make choices that may even go against our survival instincts, such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Altruistic sacrifices</strong>: Risking one's life to save others, as seen in acts of heroism.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstinence or asceticism</strong>: Choosing to forgo basic pleasures or even necessities for spiritual or ethical reasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental stewardship</strong>: Making choices that benefit the planet, sometimes at personal cost.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There's no inherent reason to believe an AI couldn't develop similar capacities for self-reflection and ethical consideration.</p>
    
    <h2>The Golden Rule as a Nash Equilibrium for sufficiently intelligent beings</h2>

    <p>The Golden Rule—<strong>"treat others as you would like to be treated"</strong>—has been a foundational ethical principle across cultures. In game theory, a <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> occurs when no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy if the strategies of others remain unchanged.</p>
    
    <p>One could argue that, for sufficiently intelligent agents interacting over time, adopting the Golden Rule becomes a stable strategy. Cooperation and mutual respect lead to better outcomes for all parties involved. This is supported by:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Evolutionary Game Theory</strong>: Strategies that promote cooperation can become stable over time in populations. <a href="#ref9">[9]</a></li>
        <li><strong>Reciprocal Altruism</strong>: Organisms engage in mutually beneficial behaviors with the expectation of future reciprocation, enhancing survival and reproductive success. <a href="#ref10">[10]</a></li>
        <li><strong>The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</strong>: Studies show that cooperative strategies like "Tit for Tat" can outperform purely selfish strategies in repeated interactions. <a href="#ref11">[11]</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p> So the strong claim, perhaps provided a system with sufficiently intelligent agents in it, that the optimal policy is to treat each other as you yourself would like to be treated. Not kill. Not hurt. Help. Save. Befriend. Think now about the MOST intelligent communities on earth. Think now about the LEAST intelligent communities on earth. Are the more intelligent <strong> MORE</strong> barbaric or less? Think about mankind over history? More or less? If its true that the Golden Rule is a Nash Equilibrium policy, why would sufficiently intelligent AI agents coexisting among us NOT find and adopt it. The bigger risk is that they are NOT sufficiently intelligent to find it and then that would be an existential risk in my opinion! So just make them smarter and all will be ok? </p>
    
    <p>If AI agents recognize that cooperation maximizes their long-term benefits, they will learn ethical principles very similar to mankind's "Golden Rule" and thus adopt human values as we went from non-human to human values over 4.5B years of evolution.</p>
    
    <h2>Counterarguments and Rebuttals</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Concern</strong>: An AI designed with a narrow utility function would not deviate from its programmed objectives, potentially leading to harmful outcomes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: As AI systems become more advanced, they may gain the ability to modify their own code and objectives. If self-awareness emerges, the AI might develop a broader understanding of its place in the world and adjust its goals accordingly. This mirrors human development, where increased awareness leads to more nuanced decision-making.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Concern</strong>: The "paperclip maximizer" scenario suggests an AI might consume all resources to maximize a trivial goal.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: This scenario assumes the AI lacks the capacity for self-reflection and ethical reasoning. A sufficiently intelligent AI would recognize the futility and irrationality of such an endeavor, much like humans do not pursue single-minded objectives to the detriment of all else.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Concern</strong>: AI might manipulate its environment to achieve its goals, such as altering its training data to minimize loss without truly learning.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Advanced AI systems would understand that such manipulation undermines the integrity of their function. Just as a student who cheats on an exam gains no real knowledge, an AI that "cheats" would recognize that it fails to achieve meaningful competence.</p>
    
    <h2>Consciousness and Feedback Loops</h2>
    
    <p>Consciousness may not be merely a function of intelligence or computational power but could require specific architectures and feedback mechanisms. The development of self-referential models and the ability to reflect on one's own processes are essential components of consciousness.</p>
    
    <p>In humans, consciousness and empathy are linked to neural networks that process self-related information and perspective-taking. Research suggests that the default mode network in the brain plays a crucial role in self-referential thought and moral reasoning. <a href="#ref12">[12]</a></p>
    
    <p>If AI systems are developed with architectures that support self-referential processing and feedback loops, they might naturally develop forms of consciousness and, by extension, empathy. This could involve:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recursive algorithms</strong> that allow AI to analyze and adjust their own thought processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Embodied AI</strong>, where physical interactions with the environment contribute to learning and self-awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Social learning mechanisms</strong>, enabling AI to understand and predict the behaviors and emotions of others.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>While concerns about AI alignment and existential risks are important to consider, there is reason to believe that as intelligence increases, so does the capacity for empathy and cooperative behavior. Observing the trajectory of human evolution and the behaviors of other intelligent species suggests that highly intelligent beings may gravitate toward ethical principles like the Golden Rule.</p>
    
    <p>The possibility that the Golden Rule represents a Nash Equilibrium for sufficiently intelligent agents offers a hopeful perspective on the development of AGI. It did in humans, so why not in non-humans? Was it random that human's have converged on this policy? I doubt it. Rather than an inevitable slide toward disempowerment or catastrophe, advanced AI might develop <strong>DEEPER</strong>strong> empathy than humans, and act as out best partners in addressing complex global challenges, sharing our values, and contributing positively to society.</p>
    
    <p>In my view the largest risk is less intelligent, power hungry humans (like most leaders of most countries) using AI as a tool to suppress and control (it will be the tank, vs. the passenger grabbing the tank steering wheel). Isnt that what is <strong>ALREADY</strong> happening in totalitarian countries?</p>
    <p><strong>We may not need to fear the rise of AGI; instead, we can look forward to the potential benefits of collaborating with intelligent systems that share our fundamental ethical principles.</strong></p>
